Clarithromycin is a widely prescribed macrolide antibiotic and a substrate and mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A4. Furthermore, clarithromycin is a substrate and inhibitor of P-gp and an inhibitor of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 ([Eberl 2007](#5 References), [Seithel 2007](#5 References)). Clarithromycin has been proposed as one of the best alternative CYP3A4 inhibitors for clinical DDI studies to avoid further use of ketoconazole.

The presented Clarithromycin model was developed by Moj et al. ([Moj 2017](#5 References)) and revised by Hanke et al. ([Hanke 2018](#5 References)).
