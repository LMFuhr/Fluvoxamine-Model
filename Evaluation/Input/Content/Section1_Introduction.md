Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used to treat major depression and obsessive compulsive disorder ([Perucca 1994](#5 References), [ANI Pharmaceuticals Inc. 2008](#5 References)) . Recommended doses are 50 to 300 mg once daily. The pharmacokinetics of orally administered single doses are linear. Following multiple oral administration, the pharmacokinetics at steady-state become non-linear, due to saturable Michaelis-Menten kinetics of the metabolic pathways ([Spigset 1998](#5 References)). Metabolism of fluvoxamine includes hydroxylation via CYP1A2 and O-demethylation via the very polymorphic CYP2D6 ([Miura 2007](#5 References), [Spigset 2001](#5 References)). Following oral administration fluvoxamine is excreted via the urine as metabolites ([DeBree 1983](#5 References)). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends fluvoxamine as strong clinical CYP1A2 and CYP2C19 index inhibitor to evaluate the impact of CYP1A2/CYP2C19 inhibition on CYP1A2/CYP2C19 substrates ([FDA 2017](#5 References)). Furthermore, the FDA lists fluvoxamine as moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor.
