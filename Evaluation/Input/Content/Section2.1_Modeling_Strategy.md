The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](# 5 References)). Information regarding the relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](# References)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim速 and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The  applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim速 are described in the publicly available PK-Sim速 Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](# 5 References)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

The clarithromycin model was developed using 17 clinical studies, covering a dosing range from 100 to 1200 mg. The model applies partitioning into blood cells, metabolism by CYP3A4 including mechanism-based auto-inactivation and a renal clearance.

Unknown parameters (see below) were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim速. 

The model was then verified by simulating:
