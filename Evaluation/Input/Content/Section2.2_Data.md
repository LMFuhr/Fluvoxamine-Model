### 2.2.2	Clinical Data

A literature search was performed to collect available clinical data on fluvoxamine in healthy adults.

The fluvoxamine PBPK model was developed using 26 different clinical studies with pharmacokinetic (PK) blood sampling. These studies include 1 study of 30 mg fluvoxamine administered intravenously (iv) as a single-dose, and 25 studies of fluvoxamine administered orally (po) in single- or multiple-doses. In the single-dose (s.d.) po studies fluvoxamine was administered in doses of 25 - 200 mg. In the multiple-dose po studies fluvoxamine was administered once (q.d.) or twice daily (b.i.d.), in doses of 10 - 150 mg per administration.
